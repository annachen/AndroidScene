AndroidScene
============

An Android app that manipulates scenes captured from the camera. Will add more features later.

This is an Eclipse project, and to use OpenCV library you'll need to download OpenCV 2.4.2 for Android, and import the OpenCV library project. For more information, see code.opencv.org/projects/opencv/wiki/OpenCV4Android
